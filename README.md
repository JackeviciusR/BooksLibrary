------------------------------------------
#### Application work.

- .NET5;
- OOP;
- DDD (Domain-driven design);
- Dependency injection
- Interfaces (for good tests, but only)
- Extensions

### Whats the plan:
- Unit Tests (Xunit, Moq);
- Need add more validation;
- Insert DataService for better data manipulation and saving;
- Refractoring code;
- Change Json file path to Data folder which is near src and tests folders;
- Need better data formating to file;
